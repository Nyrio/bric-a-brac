Command Line Tools
===

This is a compilation of multiple command-line tools I write for my own use.
You can use the tools for any personal or commercial purpose. You can also use the code as long as you credit my work.

## How to use the tools

For `.py` files, you need to [install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Most of the tools input their parameters instead of receiving them from a terminal, which makes it simpler for Windows users.
- On Windows, just double-click on the `.py` file and it will execute it with Python.
- On Unix-based systems, open a terminal in the folder and type `python3 something.py`.

## What kinds of tools are included

I'll not make a complete list here (for that I let you browse the project) but a quick overview of the tools which are currently included in the project.

 - `math`: All kinds of tools which involve some mathematics, mostly useful for videogames.
    - `interpolation`: multiple interpolation methods and algorithms related to them: 1d, parametric, BÃ©zier curves.
    - `noise`: some algorithms to generate different kinds of noise, apply dithering, etc.

- `misc`: The tools which don't fit in any other category.
